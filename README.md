In the present world, with the advent of new technologies it is always been a major concern to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data. To protect the integrity of the data over a communication channel an effective technique named Steganography emerged. Steganography techniques can be broadly divided into spatial domain-based steganography and frequency domain based steganography, based on the domain used for hiding the data. In spatial domain based steganography the data is hidden by modifying the pixel values following a specific algorithm. 
In the recent past many spatial domain steganographic techniques were proposed, but most of them does not include a pre-encryption and post-decryption stage, even if there was any encryption included the key distribution method were not safe and sound. In this project we propose Quantum key distribution for a safe transfer of the encryption key. Of the spatial domain based steganographic techniques LSB embedding algorithm is the most common and extensively used scheme. In LSB algorithm each bit of the data is embedded into each pixel over a raster scan, however this does not provide a greater complexity against intruders. In this project we propose a Hilbert space filling fractal-based k-LSB and PVD (Pixel Value Differencing) based algorithms to embed the data into the image. The data is first encrypted and the key used for encryption is send over by QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) algorithm.
