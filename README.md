### ABSTRACT:
    In this paper we propose a highly secure and high capacity PVD steganography scheme in which LZW
    compression is used to increase embedding capacity and QKD is used to improve upon the security of the RSA public key.
    The compressed secret data is encrypted using RSA algorithm resulting an encrypted data which is embedded into the
    cover image using PVD algorithm. The scheme uses Hilbert fractal-based pixel traversal and selection method so as to
    increase the randomness of the embedding process. The scheme achieved an increase in the embedding capacity of 24.6%
    when compared with existing methods. The proposed scheme also achieves an average PSNR value of 40.96 dB at 4.99
    bpp. The scheme is resilient to quantum computing and steganalysis like pixel difference histogram (PDH).
